## 1. Vectors

- Vectors are the fundamental data object in R
- There are no scalars in R, only length-1 vectors
- Vector recycling is an important feature
- You will subset vectors with square brackets `vec[]` a lot


## 2. Matrices

- Matrices are vectors with a `dim` attribute
- By default, matrices fill column by column unless `byrow=TRUE`
- `*` does element-wise multiplication
- `%*%` does matrix multiplication
- `apply()` is a great way to apply a calculation to each row or column


## 3. Lists

- Lists are "generalized" vectors
- Three ways to subset: single brackets `[]`, double brackets `[[]]`, and dollar signs `list$element`
- Single-bracket `[]` subsetting always returns a list
- `lapply()` is a great way to apply a calculation to each element of the list


## 4. Dataframes

- Under the hood, a dataframe is just a list where all list-elements (columns of the df) have the same length
